This keylogger captures all user keystrokes, takes screenshots every 7th keystroke (adjustable), 
logs timestamps and window titles using win32gui, and encrypts logs with BASE64 before sending them 
via a SOCKET connection to a server. Screenshots are accessible via HTTP on port 9090 from a hidden folder on the client PC. 
The logging session ends when the user presses 'Escape'.
